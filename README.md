# sqlalchemy-challenge

## Sources
For this module challenge, I relied heavily on in-class examples from the past weeks.
- I walked through an issue with my Precipitation graph with Danielle Dubash from my class.
- I used [this website]([url](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56102027/how-to-select-year-using-a-where-clause-on-a-datetime-type-column)https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56102027/how-to-select-year-using-a-where-clause-on-a-datetime-type-column) for assistance with the last part of the Climate App section.
