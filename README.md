# sqlalchemy-challenge

## Sources
For this module challenge, I relied heavily on in-class examples from the past weeks.
- I walked through an issue with my Precipitation graph with Danielle Dubash from my class.
- I used [this website][https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/generating-dynamic-urls-in-flask/] for assistance with the last part of the Climate App section.
